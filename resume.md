Why am I interested in the engineering pathway

I'm interested in the software engineering pathway for the same reasons I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. My biggest driving forces are a desire to give support back to my community, and a desire for work that continuously challenges me to learn more and indulge in curiosity.

When I was taking classes in software development, I loved spending hours absorbed in a coding project, or solving and debugging challenges. As a teaching assistant, I've garnered great reviews from my students for leaving thorough code review with each lab assignment. I like solvoing problems, I work well on my own or on a team, and I'm excited to learn new things. Software engineering has great potential to do a lot of good in the world. 




I'm interested in the software engineering pathway for two key reasons. The first is a desire to support my community, by both implementing solutions to impactful software projects, and redistributing my resources to people who need them more. The second reason is that I thrive in an environment where I am continuously challenged to learn more, where my curiosity will be encouraged. I know software engineering has often been a force for good in the world, and that it can do so much more for humanity.

I have been significantly happier and more fulfilled in my job as a teaching assistant at Code Fellows than I was doing data entry at Leafly, even though the pay and physical requirements for both jobs are virtually identical. I've garnered great reviews from my students and the instructors I work with for providing thorough code reviews with each lab. I care about my teammates, and do my best to help them succeed.

When I was taking classes in software development, I loved spending hours absorbed in a coding project, or solving and debugging challenges. I'm comfortable working with code on my own or in a group. Since graduating Code Fellows, I've made a point to make at least one contribution on GitHub every weekday. I've done extra Django tutorials to keep up skills, explored mobile development with Expo and React, and worked through old and new code challenges. Right now, I'm working on an application to help some friends keep track of their kids' chores during quarantine. I am excited for this opportunity to grow with Microsoft, and build software that makes an impact.

- continuous learning
- indulging curiosity
- I've put the work in studying software engineering. Been writing code every weekday since graduating. 

implement solutions on impactful projects


The final project I did at Code Fellows consisted of myself and a team of three other classmates teaching a robot to solve mazes. The most fool-proof way to solve a maze is to keep your hand on one edge of the maze, and follow every turn that edge leads you along. Since our robot lacked peripheral vision, and a sense of left-hand versus right-hand, we had to adapt. 

The most challenging part of the project came halfway through the week. Our initial idea was to have the robot, Vector, turn right at blank walls (one of our teammates made us a modular maze with wooden planks), and turn left when he saw any of the symbols he was supposed to be able to learn. After spending half a day of our limited time trying to get Vector to reliably react to a symbol, we were at our wits end. The symbols had to be a very precise size, which we weren't accurately able to recreate with the materials available to us.

I stayed late with a classmate that night. When the robot started consistently reacting to her face unprompted, I had the idea to use Vector's facial recognition capabilities to solve the maze, instead of using symble recognition. His facial recognition worked each time we needed it to work. We used printed photos of one of our teammates directly in the maze, to help guide him. As a result, we were able to guide Vector through various configurations of the maze. Other students and staff had fun watching out presentation too. As a fun bonus, I also personally got to learn more about using React, and found more ways to approach CSS layouts. The project was a success and we all got to learn more about working with integrated software.
